## Introduction

Computer programming is a process that starts with an original formulation of a problem and culminates in executable computer programs. Computer languages, like human languages, require you to use them in order to understand them.

Every program (process) has input and output. 

#### Programming paradigms
A programming paradigm is a style of programming. To program professionally, you need to learn either the object-oriented or functional programming paradigms.

#### State
One of the fundamental differences among the various programming paradigms is the handling of state. State is the value of a program's variables while it is running. Global state is the value of a program's global variables while it is running.

#### Procedural programming paradigm
Procedural programming paradigm is a programming style in which you write a sequence of steps moving toward a solutionâ€” with each step changing the program's state.You store data in global variables and manipulate it with functions

#### Functional programming paradigm
Functional programming paradigm addresses the problems that arise in procedural programming by eliminating global state. A functional programmer relies on functions that do not use or change global state, the only state they use are the parameters you pass to the function. The result, a function returns, is usually passed on to another function. A functional programmer can thus avoid global state by passing it from function to function.

#### Object-oriented programming paradigm
Object-oriented programming paradigm also addresses the problems that arise in procedural programming by eliminating global state, but instead of storing state in functions, it is stored in objects.


## Prerequisites
